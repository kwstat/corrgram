# corrgram 1.14 - Apr 2021

* The `seriation` package is moved from Imports to Suggests.  This makes `corrgram` lighter loading for most people. (Requested by P.Kiener and others)

* The `outer.labels` argument has improved default values.

# corrgram 1.13 - Jul 2018

* Test coverage at 95% using `covr` package.

* New `panel.fill()` function, omits diagonal lines.

* `panel.conf` and `panel.cor` now auto-scale based on absolute value of correlations.

* `panel.conf` now only allows `cor.method="pearson"` (which is the default.) Fix issue #13.

# corrgram 1.12 - May 2017

* New vignette about an invalid correlation matrix.

* `corrgram()` gives a better warning if a symmetric matrix has values outside [-1,1].

* Added package logo on github.

# corrgram 1.11 - Apr 2017

* New argument `outer.labels` for adding labels along outside edges of corrgram. (Request of Vanessa Bruat and others.)

# corrgram 1.10 - Nov 2016

* Function `corrgram()` now returns the correlation matrix.

* Fixed custom label ordering when `order=TRUE` for M.Bruneaux.

* Began using `testthat` package.

# corrgram 1.9 - Jul 2016

* New panel function `panel.cor` for colored correlation values.

* Fixed minor bugs with no complete cases.

* Added more cases to tests directory.

# corrgram 1.8 - Jul 2015

* Namespace changes due to R devel changes.

# corrgram 1.7 - Feb 2015

* Added more seriate options.

# corrgram 1.6 - Aug 2014

* Moved packages from Depends to Imports.

* Argument `label.pos` now defaults to c(.5, .5) for x,y positioning. (Request of Evan Williams).

* New argument `cor.method`. (Request of Evan Williams).

# corrgram 1.5 - Aug 2013

* Updated references links.  (Request of Michael Friendly).

* Fixed small bug with test for correlation matrix. (Reported by F. Rosa)

# corrgram 1.4 - Nov 2012

* New argument `col.regions` to specify panel colors.

* Re-worked examples section for more variety.

# corrgram 1.3 - Aug 2012

* New panel function `panel.bar`.  (Request of dadrivr)

* Added example for unclipped labels (in the test suite).

# corrgram 1.2 - Mar 2012

* Small bug.  Now accepts NA values in correlation matrices, and NAs caused by missing combinations of data and cor(use="pair").

* Non-numeric columns in the data will be ignored. (Request of JZ)

* New panel function `panel.density`.

* Test suite now includes corrgram of inverse correlation, partial correlation matrices.

# corrgram 1.1 - Oct 2011

* Added namespace.

# corrgram 1.0 - Jul 2011

* New panel function `panel.conf`.

* New data set `vote`.

* New arguments `dir`, `type`, `label.srt`, `title`, `abs`.

* Now works for either a data.frame or a correlation matrix using the `type` argument.

* New ordering method `OLO` using `seriation` package.

* Ordering can now be done on absolute value of correlations.

# corrgram 0.1 - Dec 2006
